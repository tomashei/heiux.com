                        &nbsp; &nbsp; My way to <span class="pDark">User Experience Design</span> was not straightforward.

                                                &nbsp; &nbsp; My first motivation is IT. I started my higher education at the Computer Science faculty, where I gathered basics knowledge of programming and crucial skill for my future career: <span class="pDark">algorithmic thinking</span>. After two semesters I decided to move forward and I passed a drawing exam to Architecture Faculty.

                                                &nbsp; &nbsp; My second motivation is Design. I obtained a Master’s Degree in Architecture and Urban Planning. But the most crucial was a year when I was an exchange student in Istanbul. There I meet a mentor who change my life: prof. Ozan Önder Özener. He thought me the basics of Computational Design, a field of design using algorithms to generate parametric geometries.

                                                &nbsp; &nbsp; Computational Design became the major topic of my Master’s Thesis and subsequently mayor field of Ph.D. research. I was teaching junior students basics while polishing my skill-set. Then, after one year another milestone happened, I got a job offer from one of the most influential architects of our time: Ma Yansong, founder of MAD Architects from Beijing. It was like winning a lottery.

Before moving to the Middle Kingdom, I already studied the basics of Mandarin for about one year. At MAD Architects, I was part of a team developing one of the most influential architectural projects of the XXI century: Harbin Opera House. I built life-lasting impactful friendships with peers all around the world and met my wife to be.

My proficiency in Chinese increased rapidly and I accepted an offer as a project leader at the local design institute. I successfully led a team containing 10 Mandarin-only speaking designers.

                <h4>The story begins</h4>
                <h3>Intersection of Programming,<br>Design and Adventure</h3>

                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; It was around 2007 when I for the first time heard term <span class="pDark h2Red">usability</span>, but at that time I was not ready for becoming UX Designer. I was then a <span class="pDark">computer science</span> student and I treated it as a <span class="pDark">curiosity</span>. I was simply too absorbed by studying algorithms and programming languages to see the world from the perspective of users.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; One year later, I made an important decision to abandon computer science and I was accepted by an <span class="pDark">architecture faculty</span>. I had a feeling that computer science was too technical. My mission was always to <span class="pDark"></span>create good for people, it is why that time I did many <span class="pDark">charity works</span>. I helped homeless, poor and rejected people. During this time as an <span class="pDark">architecture student</span>, I started to see the world from the perspective of users, and I began to ask myself <span class="pDark">questions</span>. How would people feel inside this space? How would it work for people? How space could influence emotions?<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The next milestone happened when I was accepted as an international exchange student by the <span class="pDark">Istanbul</span> Technical University. I spent the second year of my master's degree in this ancient city, where for centuries eastern culture met the western one. That time I took a <span class="pDark">great effort</span> to study the Turkish language. When my flatmates and friends went for parties, I was sitting in my room and constantly repeat Turkish lessons. After one year I was capable of speaking Turkish relatively fluent, and it was somehow <span class="pDark">a great achievement</span> for me as Turkish is not an Indo-European language.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; But what was <span class="pDark"> most important</span>, it also opened my eyes to a different culture, allowed me to <span class="pDark">communicate</span> with completely unknown people. For the first time, I also realized <span class="pDark">how similar</span> European languages and cultures were. When I was learning English at school, I had a feeling it was so different from my mother's tongue Polish. But when I became proficient in language with completely <span class="pDark">different roots</span>, I started to see overwhelming deep similarities, in grammar, in way of thinking and most importantly in Latin roots of a great part of the vocabulary.

A way of thinking of buildings as of computer programs, where all parts of geometry could be <span class="pDark">mathematically described</span>. My background in computer science and knowledge of C# gave me a <span class="pDark">tremendous advantage</span> over other peers in my class. In days, I was able to absorb and apply the knowledge that took other students months or more to do. Very soon Parametric Design became my <span class="pDark">strongest asset</span>, and topic of my master thesis.

                <h4>The professional journey begins </h4>
                <h3>Time as an Architect </h3>
                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; After finishing my master's degree, I graduated from architecture faculty in 2014 and the <span class="pLight">next milestone</span> happened. That time, I studied Chinese for around one year, and I was invited for 3 months-long internship to Guizhou province by a local design institute. I had spent amazing and productive time in the Middle Kingdom and I knew, one day I had to come back to China.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; After coming back to Poland started to work for the same Chinese design institute, which wanted to open the European branch of the company. <span class="pLight">Simultaneously</span> my employer supported me to <span class="pLight">start a Ph.D.</span> This way I spent the next few months studying, working on architecture projects and practicing Chinese.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Good things, however, have a tendency not too last too long. My Chinese employer realized that they were not yet ready to move the creative process to Europe. My Chinese was also not yet good enough to coordinate projects using only this language. I was left with started Ph.D., and for the first time in life technically <span class="pLight">jobless</span>...<br><br>

                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; That time events started to accelerate again, I designed a portfolio and sent it to a few selected studios in China. A few days later, <span class="pLight">magic happened</span>... I got an invitation for an interview from <span class="pLight">MAD Architects</span>. The studio, I learned about in university, I admired their buildings in design magazines and they wanted to talk with me. I could not <span class="pLight">believe</span> what was happening. The interview went relatively easy. The studio was mostly interested in my parametric design skill-set. A few days later I got a job offer letter, and I knew it was one in a <span class="pLight">million chance</span>, it was that time or never. I borrowed money from parents, bought a one-way ticket and two weeks later I was on a plane to <span class="pLight">Beijing</span>.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Time at MAD Architects was definitely the <span class="pLight">most important experience</span> of my life. I worked a lot, even as for Chinese standards: 360 or more hours a month (yes, yes it is around 12 hours a day without free weekends). I learned a crucial lesson: that <span class="pLight">perfection</span> never comes from anything, but it is a series of <span class="pLight">countless iterations</span> and almost impossible persistence.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; What was the most important however are the <span class="pLight">friendships</span> I build and incredibly <span class="pLight">skilled people</span> I had the opportunity to meet. MAD Architects were a unique mixture of cultures, collecting the best of the best designers from all around the world. I believe that everyone has an interesting story to tell, experience to share, and only what I had to do was <span class="pLight">to listen</span>. So, I listened and learned.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; During my time at MAD Architects, I contributed to many <span class="pLight">world-class</span> projects, build meaningful friendships and matured as a designer. A year later, I felt it was time for a change. I realized that as working for star architect was an amazing experience, there was one crucial issue. The last word always belonged to the principal architect, and many crucial decisions were not data-based, on the contrary, they were <span class="pLight">arbitrary</span>. As many of the studio's projects are icons of modern architecture, knowledge of an undergoing process started to interrupt me. I felt our buildings were somehow isolated, and we often <span class="pLight">ignored</span> the opinions and feelings of future users.<br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to try to be closer to users. I decided to leave my position at MAD Architects and accepted a job offer from a new studio created by two talented, more experienced architects who just left Ole Scheeren's office in Beijing. They were looking for their own <span class="pLight">creative identity</span>.<br><br> 

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; As our newly built team, we worked extremely hard to provide great designs. My <span class="pLight">personal impact</span> on projects grew dramatically. I was able to propose many data-based solutions, that were enthusiastically <span class="pLight">accepted</span> by principal architects and clients. Our team worked hard and our effort was awarded by winning a series of iconic competitions in Asia.<br><br>

My <span class="pDark">Chinese proficiency</span> also increased greatly, and it finally opened long-closed doors to the ancient culture. As the work pace was much slower, I had more time to travel with my wife around Asia, and again <span class="pDark">learn</span> from a different culture.<br><br>

                <h4>Rediscovering UX</h4>
                <h3>Back to the roots</h3>

                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; This time, during one of my evening readings I found an eBook version of <span class="pDark">'Don't make me think'</span>, written by Steve Krug in my hands. I absorbed the book in a few days, and almost <span class="pDark">twelve years later</span>, again I came across term <span class="pDark h2Red">usability</span>. This time it was not just a curiosity but a real problem - this time I knew it was something more. As I read more and more about designing experiences I started to realize it was a field that I was always looking for. It connected three crucial fields that shaped my personality: computer science, design and the ability to <span class="pDark">make people's</span> lives better. <br><br>

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, in the spring of 2019, I decided to quit my <span class="pDark">lucrative position</span> as the project architect in Guizhou. I was 100 percent sure, that  I wanted to become a <span class="pDark">User Experience</span> Designer. I knew that the long way that led me to this moment was not wasted time, but a <span class="pDark">complex process</span> that will allow me to design excellent experiences. I had enough connections and skills to sustain my life as a freelance architect. I traveled with my wife around China while working with demanding Chinese projects and <span class="pDark">studying</span> User Experience design. I was reading more and more books, articles and video courses.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; As I <span class="pDark">progressed</span> into the field of Experience Design, I started to see glaring <span class="pDark">resemblances</span> between skills necessary for architects and UX Designers. The biggest differences are scales and timelines. Architectural projects often take <span class="pDark">years to finish</span> and are almost exclusively designed in the Waterfall methodology. Changes are simply too expensive or almost impossible to execute. While in UX Design products are <span class="pDark">technically never finished</span>. Agile or lean methodologies are iterative from their nature. There is always something that could be changed, there is always a way to <span class="pDark">upgrade</span> the product. And it is great!

This great <span class="pDark">historical heritage</span> is an amazing thing but it also makes architects <span class="pDark">resistant to innovations</span>.
