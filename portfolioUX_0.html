                <h3>About Pill Reminder</h3>

                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The following case study describes my attempt to create a redesign of an open-source Pill Remainder application for Android called <a href="https://github.com/jclehner/rxdroid" target="_blank">RxDroid</a>. I had chosen an <span class="pDark">open-source</span> application for very utilitarian reasons. Many people transferring to UX Design from other disciplines decide to try to redesign very popular and successful digital products. Others try to design conceptual applications from scratch, I do not say it is a bad approach. Everone's resources are precious. My humble intention was to learn, gather experience and in the meantime <span class="pDark">contribute</span> something meaningful to the community.                         
                <br></p>

                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Open-source applications have a long <span class="pDark">reputation</span> for being very technical, often designed and maintained by geeks for other geeks. It is of course only partially true and there are many great examples of excellent applications for the wider group of users. It is, however true that for some reasons not many open-source applications have the opportunity to incorporate <span class="pDark">fully-fledged</span> UX processes into their development.

                <h3>The Design Process</h3>
                <p class="pBig pArticle pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>                        
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; During this study, I followed the <span class="pDark">Double Diamond</span> process created by Design Council. It has a great number of advantaged allowing to organize design and to prevent the designer from achieving random results. On the other hand, the relationship between <span class="pDark">diverging</span> and <span class="pDark">converging</span> phases is agile enough to be easily adjusted to specific design needs. I believe that each design is different, and for each project, slightly different methodologies should be used. The framework, however always stays the same.

I assumed that the <span class="pDark">Baby Boomers</span> generation - people aged between <span class="pDark">55-73</span> are the most likely to use Pill Reminder application in their daily life.

The <span class="pDark">biggest issue</span> I had was not to find new participants but to politely finish the testing sessions.

During the process, I <span class="pDark">shared</span> my concepts with users that I had the opportunity to interview before. I used their opinions as stakeholders' reviews.

Even when the product is ready for release there are always <span class="pDark">opportunities for improvement</span>. Failure is definitely one of them. I learned that wireframes should RAW, colorless, technically the rawer the better. It is why I updated my concept and get back to the users.

They did not hasitate to criticise and give <span class="pDark">their own ideas</span>. We could talk about functionality and features. I geathered great amount of useful information, and updated wireframes one more time.

At this stage, I did a lot of <span class="pDark">micro-testinng</span> with just 2-3 tests every few days. Then review test results, iterate and prepare an updated version of the wireframes.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; The design process technically <span class="pDark">never finishes</span>. There are always new tools to be used, new technologies constantly emerge, patterns change.

                        <li>Users are generally willing to share their opinions and talk about their feelings. The tricky part is to <span class="pDark">moderate interviews well</span>, so the small talk is limited to the necessary minimum.</li>
                        <li>Exploring beyond domain is <span class="pDark">crucial for innovation</span>. I believe that looking for inspiration in different fields is very important. Similar problems to our own could be already solved in a slightly different context.</li>
                        <li>The first idea is rarely the best. <span class="pDark">Sketching on paper is important.</span> I believe the more ideas are transferred onto paper, the higher the chance is to create an innovative product.</li>
                        <li><span class="pDark">Wireframes should be RAW.</span> I learned the more unpolished the wireframes look like, the more likely users are to give constructive feedback.</li>
                        <li>Designers should also consider <span class="pDark">removing unnecessary features</span>. There is a tendency in the industry to develop products by adding new features, but it is not always the best solution. Sometimes simplification could also increase usability.</li>

                <ol class="pList pListSmall pMargin"><span class="pDark"></span>
                        <li>Brainstorming: by introducing some simple relaxing games.
